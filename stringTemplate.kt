/* This program informs users about the upcoming promotional sale on a particular item. It has a string template, which relies on the discountPercentage variable for the percent discount and the item variable for the item on sale. However, there are compilation errors in the code.
​​
fun main() {
    val discountPercentage: Int = 0
    val offer: String = ""
    val item = "Google Chromecast"
    discountPercentage = 20
    offer = "Sale - Up to $discountPercentage% discount on $item! Hurry up!"
    
    println(offer)
}
Can you figure out the root cause of the errors and fix them?
Can you determine the output of this program before you run the code in Kotlin Playground?
Hint: Can you re-assign a value to a read-only variable?
​
After you fix the errors, the program should compile without errors and print this output:
​
​
Sale - Up to 20% discount on Google Chromecast! Hurry up!
